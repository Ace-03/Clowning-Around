    dialogueOne:
    - "That\u2019s kind of a weird name."
    - "Ha! you\u2019re right. Neither of us are very well defined. I guess we have
      that in common. So\u2026.. Uh\u2026.."
    - "Y- Yeah I live about 30 minutes north of here. It\u2019s a really nice area
      and I just repainted my house too. Here take a look! It\u2019s not great\u2026
      but I think it looks nice\u2026"
    dialogueTwo:
    - "Why would you say that!? I\u2019m sorry... I just look like this."
    - "Oh\u2026\u2026 Sorry\u2026\u2026. A-Anyway, So then, are you from around here?"
  - question: The clown hands you a simplistic crayon drawing of a house*
    dialogueOne:
    - "Thanks I put a lot of time into painting it. Most people get really weird
      about my house when I show them it. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re different though."
    - Exactly! I always feel like no one knows what it's like to be poorly drawn.
    - "One second\u2026 uh\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u2026 looks like I need to get going.
      C-Can I get some kind of contact info\u2026 or something."
    dialogueTwo:
    - "No\u2026 that's actually a photo."
    - What?
    - "It\u2019s a photo of my house."
    - "C-Can we just move onto something else\u2026"
    - "Y-You know what, I-I think I should go. This isn\u2019t working out\u2026"

    - "So then, are you from around here? I see lots of strange folks around here
      but you\u2019re very unique uh\u2026 looking?"

    choice2: Wow!
    responsesOne:
    - Wow! I actually think that looks really nice! Very blue!
    - Of course! I understand how it feels when people can be overly critical about
      your work.
    - "Yeah, it\u2019s definitely a unique situation."
    responsesTwo:
    - Oh, so this is like a drawing of your house? So then I guess you painted it
      blue?
    - Huh?
    - "What do you mean it\u2019s a photo?"
    - "No, that's clearly a drawing. I can even tell that you used crayon, and look!
      The house has one window and a door and it\u2019s not even three dimensional."
    - "\u2026"
