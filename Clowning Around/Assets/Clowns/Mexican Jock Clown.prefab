  dialogues:
  - question: 
    dialogueOne:
    - Hola, stranger. Why did the wrestler open a bakery?
    dialogueTwo: []
  - question: because he kneaded dough. Ja ja ja.
    dialogueOne:
    - I do both Grisita.
    - 'What kind of question is that? That is very random, but no I have never tried
      to do both at the same time. '
    - "Okay, what\u2019s your favorite food?"
    dialogueTwo:
    - Well what do you got? Hmm?
    - "Yea, that\u2019s what I thought. Grisita."
    - "It\u2019s a term of endearment."
    - Yes, I just made it up now. I make up nicknames for everyone.
    - "Okay, what\u2019s your favorite food?"
  - question: "Really! What\u2019s your favorite part of the pizza-making process
      Grisita?"
    dialogueOne:
    - Yes! I completely agree. But my favorite part is eating it after. Ja ja
    - We should plan to cook together Grisita. How about it?
    dialogueTwo:
    - Sticking it in the oven? STICKING IT IN THE OVEN?
    - Frozen! Why not make it yourself?
    - "The same. They taste the same. Este peque\xF1o idiota. No han trabajado ni
      un d\xEDa de su vida. \xBFLa pizza es dif\xEDcil de hacer? Eso es rid\xEDculo.
      No puedo estar con alguien tan vago. PENDEJO!! "
  responses:
  - choice1: 
    choice2: 
    responsesOne:
    - Yo no se.
    responsesTwo: []
  - choice1: Does that mean you wrestle?
    choice2: "I\u2019m sorry that joke was a little boring."
    responsesOne:
    - Does that mean you wrestle? Or do you like to bake?
    - "You do? That\u2019s so cool. Have you ever done both at the same time?"
    - Oh yeah, I guess that was a bit of a weird question. It probably would be messy.
    responsesTwo:
    - "I\u2019m sorry that joke was a little boring."
    - "Well I don\u2019t really have anything. I would have to think about it a bit
      more."
    - Did you just call me Baby Gray?
    - It is?
    - "Okay, that\u2019s actually very sweet. Then I\u2019ll call you Jock."
    - "Well, I do love pizza\u2026"
  - choice1: After kneading the dough, letting it rise and applying sauce.
    choice2: Sticking it in the oven?
    responsesOne:
    - 'After kneading the dough, letting it rise and applying sauce. I love decorating
      it with toppings.  '
    - Oh my gosh. I love that part too. Ha ha ha.
    responsesTwo:
    - "Yeah, I have to since it\u2019s frozen. "
    - "That\u2019s a lot of effort. Especially when they just taste the same."
  goodbye:
    goodEnding: 'Mexican Jock Clown stands up excited about your future cooking adventures.
      He gives a thumbs and saunders off laughing. '
    badEnding: He throws his hat at you and fake spits. He rises up from his seat
      and refuses to look back.
