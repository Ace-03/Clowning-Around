    dialogueOne:
    - "\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.."
    - "\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.."
    - "Shhhhhhhhhhhh, don\u2019t interrupt my mewing my little protein shake. I know
      you're stunned by the work of art displayed in front of you. But don\u2019t
      worry I\u2019ll take goooood care of you. *Boop.*"
    dialogueTwo: []
  - question: Ah I see, your little obsession with me is cute little P.S. As for
      what I do in my free time, I do a little something on Tik Tok here and there.
      Let me show you.* A growling sound begins to erupt from the phone speaker.*
    dialogueOne:
    - "Grrrrrrrrr\u2026 Did you like that my little P.S."
    - "mmmmm. I\u2019m glad you could tell. This is just a side gig for His Chadness
      since protein powder doesn\u2019t buy itself."
    - 'Shhhhhhhhh, he is right in front of you baby girl. Worship me in all my glory. '
    dialogueTwo:
    - Do you now understand the talent that is His Chadness? *Mews*
    - Shhhhhhhhh, he is right in front of you baby girl. Worship me in all my glory.
  - question: "Don\u2019t worry, my little protein shake. You wouldn\u2019t be alone
      in your new religion. You would be joining 39 others."
    dialogueOne:
    - 'Aren''t you a smart little thing, my little protein shake. I could just gulp
      you down. Wink.  '
    - You. Me. Gym. I workout and guzzle down protein shakes and you cheer me on.
      Are you down my little protein shake? Grrrrrrrrrrr
    dialogueTwo:
    - "That\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong lil P.S. All religions have to start somewhere
      and it begins with a god.  "
    - "A good little protein shake doesn\u2019t go against its lord! When you're
      ready to be blessed by His Chadness you\u2019ll know where to find me. He releases
      your chin stomps off."

    - "That\u2019s a really sharp jawline you got there. Were you uh, born with it
      or did you work for it?"

    responsesTwo: []
  - choice1: Hell no
    choice2: Sure
    responsesOne:
    - "Oh, yea sure. Doesn\u2019t seem like I have much of a choice. Ha. *You watch
      all three of his thirst traps he has posted on tik tok. They are artistic to
      say the least.*"
    - Oh, yeaaa. I could really feel your talent through the screen. *Smiles awkwardly.*
    - "His Chadness, who is His Chadnes\u2026"
    responsesTwo:
    - Oh, no thank you I think I understand the idea. No need to show me. *He showed
      me anyway. All three of his thirst traps tik toks. All shirtless. All over
      a minute.*
    - "Okay. Umm. I\u2019m sorry. Who is His Chadnes\u2026"
    - "Worship? Like a God. Umm that seems a little\u2026"

    responsesOne:
    - 'Wow 39! That''s definitely a large number. Ha ha. He slides a finger down
      your face from your nose to your chin. '
    - Uh, Um, Uh. Thank you!
    responsesTwo:
    - "39 isn\u2019t a lot. I think I have more followers than you actually. I don't
      think that's enough to start a religion. "
    - " That\u2019s not much of religion that's more of a cult. Plus I\u2019m not
      sure how many of those people actually worship yo\u2026 He grabbed my chin
      and pulled it towards him. "
    - "Goodbye. Your \u2026 Chadness. His \u2026. Chadness.  "
