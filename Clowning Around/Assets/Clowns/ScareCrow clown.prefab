  - question: "Hey, what\u2019s your favorite poetry writer? Mine\u2019s Edger Allen
      Crow! :D"
    dialogueOne:
    - "Gasp Dr. Seuss?! Oh, you poor soul! Have you not experienced the pain of loss
      through the many poems about Poe\u2019s dead lovers? I can share a few poems
      of his if you wish?"
    - "Yes, a person willing to admit to what they lack. I guess you have potential.
      Others only like to squawk about what they believe without listening to the
      other person. Can you believe that? It is such a wild notion to me that people
      don\u2019t like to hear other peoples different opinions.  "
    dialogueTwo:
    - "\u2026Excuse me? Shakespear? I can not have heard that right. That buffoon
      has written nothing of value in his entire life. All he has left for this world
      is the many cliches that have perpetuated more literature with no substance. "
  - question: Let me tell you of the immaculate dining experience that is the crops,
      my little carrot. It is just a delight munching on the premature vegetables.
      The crunch mixed with the flavors of the earth can not simply be described.
      It is a truly wonderful experience.
    dialogueOne:
    - "You are such a wonderfully open person. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met anyone
      before who was so open into trying the hobbies I am interested in. Many people
      find it weird or creepy but you have truly been incredible. "
    - If you would like my little carrot we can arrange to meet again. The next date
      could be over Thai iced coffee before we go on a big one. How does that sound?
      Scratchy laughter.
    dialogueTwo:
    - "Ugh, you ignorant swine. How could you be so daft as to not understand! You
      know what, you don\u2019t even realize how significant mother nature's original
      meal is to this world. You don\u2019t have enough cawmotions to be near me.
      We are done here. "
  responses:

    responsesOne: []
    responsesTwo: []
  - choice1: ' Dr. Seuss'
    choice2: Shakespeare
    responsesOne:
    - "uhhhh\u2026 ummm\u2026 Dr. Seuss?"
    - 'Actually I would love that. It w-would be nice to expand my reading. Smiles
      sheepishly. '
    - "Oh. Yes. I see your point. I can\u2019t believe anyone would do that. Ha,
      ha\u2026 How about we move on? What is your favorite date to go on?"
    responsesTwo:
    - Have you heard of Shakespeare? Lopsided smile. Romeo and Juliet is an example
      of artistic genius if you ask me.
    - "Oh. Yes. I see your point. I\u2019m not sure if I agree. Smiles brightly.
      Ha, He Hu\u2026 How about we move on? What is your favorite date to go on?"
  - choice1: What a unique experience.
    choice2: "That\u2019s very unsanitary."
    responsesOne:
    - "What a unique experience. Smiles brightly. I\u2019ve never tried anything
      like that before but it seems \u2026 fascinating. I\u2019d definitely be open
      to trying."
    - "Thank you. I don\u2019t find you creepy. Maybe a little unorthodox but definitely
      not creepy. I really enjoy talking to you. You\u2019re very full of life with
      such an incredible mind."
    responsesTwo:
    - "I\u2019m sorry did you say \u201Cthe flavors of the earth?\u201D Are you telling
      me you don\u2019t wash them at all? That\u2019s very unsanitary. "
  goodbye:
    goodEnding: He stands up stretching near his hat shyly. He takes his straw hand
      and ruffles your hair leaving stray pieces of straw in it before he leaves.
    badEnding: He rustles as he stands up. Shaking his head at you in disappointment.
      He slowly walks to the door as stray straw falls from his hands.
