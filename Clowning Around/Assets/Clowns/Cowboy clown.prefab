  dialogues:
  - question: 
    dialogueOne:
    - "This is a stick up. Don\u2019t move otherwise I\u2019ll shoot ya. Yee haw!
      *Pew*"
    - "I\u2019m sorry milady but I can\u2019t hand over my handkerchief to some woman.
      Ya gotta prove me to me that yer special. Yee haw! "
    - "Isn\u2019t that right Randy? "
    - 'Why yes milady. It seems that you have better taste than most women. This
      is Randy. Yee Haw! '
    dialogueTwo: []
  - question: His voice is a little hoarse. Yee Haw!
    dialogueOne:
    - "Ya got it. It\u2019s nice to see a woman with a sense of humor. Yee Haw!"
    - "Aren\u2019t ya gonna ask me anything about Randy? Yee Haw!"
    dialogueTwo:
    - The only thing he is stuffed with milady is manly prowess. A woman would never
      be able to understand the relationship between a man and his horse. Yee Haw!
    - "Randy, isn't it so hard to find a good partner these days. It\u2019s always
      me, me, me with these women. They\u2019re never interested in you. It\u2019s
      okay, don't feel sad boy. Yee Haw!"
  - question: Well milady I am glad you asked. Me and Randy here have been through
      thick and thin. I first met him at a ranch. My poor boy here was abandoned
      by some hillbillies without a heart for animals. Yee Haw!
    dialogueOne:
    - Ya think so? Yee Haw!
    - Well milady you sure do know how to make a cowboy blush. We should do this
      again sometime and can show you the prowess of a real man. Yee Haw!
    dialogueTwo:
    - Excuse ya, little lady. He was not stolen. I saved him from a terrible home.
      No horse should have to live through those conditions. YEE HAW!
    - "I was 32 milady. And I was not stealing. It\u2019s just like a woman to think
      like that. Don\u2019t ya think Randy? Yee Haw!"
    - "Milady I reckon we\u2019re done here. Ya clearly have a screw loose. I hope
      Randy and I don\u2019t see ya around. Good day, WOMAN!"
  responses:
  - choice1: 
    choice2: 
    responsesOne:
    - '*He shot me. With a water gun. Now I am soaked.* Hi, umm do you think I could
      use your handkerchief to dry off a little?'
    - "I\u2019m sorry but are you talking to your horse?"
    - "Umm, actually I don\u2019t really identify as\u2026"
    - "Oh noooo\u2026. Why do you think Randy is sick?"
    responsesTwo: []
  - choice1: Ha ha ha. Neigh!
    choice2: '*Stares blankly*'
    responsesOne:
    - "Ha ha ha. Neigh! *That was incredibly awkward. I hope he doesn\u2019t think
      I\u2019m rude.*"
    - "Ahh\u2026 thank you I guess."
    responsesTwo:
    - '*Stares blankly* You do realize your horse is stuffed right?'
    - "Like I was trying to say earlier I don\u2019t really\u2026"
    - '*Rolls eyes* So how did you meet Randy?'
  - choice1: They abandoned a toy horse.
    choice2: Oh my goodness that's horrible.
    responsesOne:
    - "Oh my goodness that's horrible. I\u2019m glad that you found him. You seem
      to have a very big heart."
    - Yes, I think you and Randy are both very good boys.
    - Yes, I would like that. Yee Haw! P
    responsesTwo:
    - "They abandoned a toy horse. Like on the side of the road? Wouldn\u2019t that
      mean you stole him?"
    - "But he was probably left out by someone since he\u2019s a toy. How old were
      you when you found him?"
    - Stop talking to the horse, he is the victim! Randy, if you need help let me
      know. *Reaches out to grab Randy but he smacks my hand away*
  goodbye:
    goodEnding: He smiles broadly and winks at you while tipping his hat. Him and
      Randy walk side by side into the next train car.
    badEnding: "He grabs Randy and hops. He rides his horse off into the sunset.
      Well\u2026 into the next train car.  "
