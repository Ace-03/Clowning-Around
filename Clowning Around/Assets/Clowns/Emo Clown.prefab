  dialogues:
  - question: 
    dialogueOne:
    - '*Something inaudible*'
    - '*Just barely loud enough to hear.* Do you listen to music?'
    dialogueTwo: []
  - question: "Oh cool\u2026 What do you usually listen to?"
    dialogueOne:
    - "I like how you think, little wolf. I am partial to the emo genre myself; it
      reflects the pain I feel inside\u2026"
    - "would have to say my favorite artist is\u2026 My Parasocial Romance. Sometimes
      the music speaks what you feel inside."
    - With pleasure, little wolf.
    dialogueTwo:
    - "My heart is forever broken by your insulting words\u2026"
    - "I have an emo heart, but a fragile soul. Those who hate our music don\u2019t
      understand the cruelties of the world. You don\u2019t understand our pain."
    - "Little wolf, you can\u2019t mend my broken heart."
  - question: "I chose a career that reflected my inner-turmoil, so that I can show
      my pain to the world. Whether they laugh at my idiocy or cry in sympathy, I
      know I\u2019ve made an impact. In a world where everyone wears black, it\u2019s
      a privilege to see a soul that attempts to see others. I wish to mourn the
      imminent death of our morality with my people, and I believe this is the best
      way to reach them all."
    dialogueOne:
    - "Thank you, little wolf. I\u2019m feeling the weight of the world, but still
      standing tall."
    dialogueTwo:
    - Be careful how far you push me away, I may end up liking it there.
  - question: "When I was a young boy\u2026 My father introduced me to the emo culture.
      He said \u201Cson, when you grow up, will you continue my legacy and live an
      emo lifestyle?\u201D How could I refuse? The emo life was the savior of my
      broken, beaten soul. He told me to be the one to defeat my demons, and the
      demons of the world. One day, he left me, and walks a dark march as a phantom
      in the summer\u2026"
    dialogueOne:
    - "Thank you for your kind words, little wolf\u2026 I hope life treats you better
      than it treats me\u2026I really enjoyed talking to you\u2026 Are you free tomorrow
      night?"
    dialogueTwo:
    - "No one understands my pain\u2026I hope you suffer for your crimes against
      the soul\u2026"

    - "I have not heard of them, you\u2019ll have to show me some of their music
      sometime."
    - "Ok\u2026 how about a different conversation topic? Why did you become a clown?"
    responsesTwo:
    - "Anything but emo music\u2026 It's too depressing for me."

  - choice1: Clowning is kind of lame
    choice2: "I think that\u2019s a\u2026 noble cause."
    responsesOne:

    - "I wish you luck in your\u2026 endeavors. What drew you to emo culture?"
    responsesTwo:
    - "I think clowning is a bit of a lame way to make an impact\u2026"
    - "*\u2026That was the most emo thing I have ever heard\u2026* Ok then\u2026What
      drew you to emo culture?"
  - choice1: "That\u2019s a little too edgy"
