  dialogues:
  - question: 
    dialogueOne:
    - Hello, my dear. You seem nervous. Let me lighten the mood with a joke. Why
      do goths always win staring contests?
    dialogueTwo: []
  - question: "They\u2019ve mastered the death stare! *She chuckles to herself.*"
    dialogueOne:
    - "I am indeed a part-time clown. I also have an ASMR YouTube channel, where
      I tell my jokes and do tarot reading. I have quite a few jokes up my sleeve.
      Play your cards right and I\u2019ll tell them to you. *Smirking*"
    - "I\u2019ve learned a lot in my clowning classes, and I hope to bring an interesting
      twist to the genre, what with my affinity towards goth culture."
    dialogueTwo:
    - "Well that\u2019s no fun. Though I dress differently and have unique interests,
      I\u2019m just like everyone else. You should learn to be more open-minded and
      respectful."
    - "It\u2019s alright, I suppose. Be sure to improve your behavior, or you will
      suffer the consequences, naughty one. *Soul-piercing glare.*"
  - question: "I\u2019d like to get to know you a bit better, if I\u2019m going to
      consider dating you. What are your hobbies, dear?"
    dialogueOne:
    - "Hm. Interesting. I myself like to watch the blood seep from my enemies\u2019
      skulls as I crush them with my razor heels. I hope to never have to watch the
      life leave your eyes, however; you\u2019re growing on me."
    - I may look weak but I can hold my own, trust me. If I decide to continue dating
      you, know that I will protect you as well.
    - You are sweet, dear. Shall we meet again next moon? I am excited to discover
      more things about you.
    dialogueTwo:
    - "You are exceptionally boring. Why are you even speed dating if you won\u2019t
      make an effort to connect with people?"
    - "Begone, you are not worthy of my presence. We do not need to continue our
      \u201Cdate\u201D, if you can even call it that at this point. *She storms off.*"

    responsesOne:
    - "*Shrugs shoulders.* I don\u2019t know. Why?"
    responsesTwo: []
  - choice1: "Your vibe honestly scares me a little\u2026"
    choice2: '*Nervous laughter.* Good one!'
    responsesOne:
    - '*Nervous laughter.* Good one! Are you really a clown or is the outfit just
      for aesthetics?'
    - "*Why does it feel like she can see into my soul\u2026?* Aha\u2026 Sounds cool!
      Are you self taught?"
    - "I certainly have never seen a real goth clown. You are definitely\u2026 unique."
    responsesTwo:
    - "Your vibe honestly scares me a little\u2026"
    - "I-I\u2019m sorry ma\u2019am\u2026 *I didn\u2019t sign up for a lecture when
      I hopped on this train\u2026*"
    - "Yes, ma\u2019am\u2026 *You feel as if you should look away from her.*"
  - choice1: "I don\u2019t really feel comfortable telling you\u2026"
    choice2: "Um\u2026 I like to\u2026 paint?"
    responsesOne:
    - "Um\u2026 I like to\u2026 paint?"
    - "*What kind of a clown is she??* Oh\u2026 Cool? I suppose?"
    - "\u2026Thanks\u2026 *I feel simultaneously honored and terrified.*"
    responsesTwo:
    - "I don\u2019t really feel comfortable telling you\u2026"
    - "*\u2026I genuinely do not know what to say\u2026* I\u2019ll be honest, I just
      wanted to go to Clown-Con. MG"
