    responsesOne:
    - 'Oh nice to meet you too? *Am I losing my mind or is that a fish bowl with
      a wig on top?* '
    - "You\u2019re probably wondering what I\u2019m doing here. Right? "
    - 'Riiiiigggghhhhttt. I wanted a change of pace from my everyday life. It felt
      a little suffocating. Ha get it. Suffocating. '
    - Ha, sorry, bad joke. So what do you do for work?
    responsesTwo:
    - "Well aren\u2019t you kinda cute with your little wig and clown nose."
    - "How did you even buy these things you have no hands. Where\u2019d you get
      it, Seaworld? *Hehhehehe*"

    responsesOne:
    - "That sounds really important. *I think I\u2019m starting to understand him*
      That must have taken a lot of schooling to get to your current position. You\u2019re
      very hard working."

      he he. *Why did I say that? That was a lot of assuming*
    - "I\u2019m sorry! That was wrong of me but you didn\u2019t have to say it like
      that. "
    - "Telling me the same thing again doesn\u2019t change anything. I apologized!
      You\u2019re really letting all this bubble up to the surface. I guess we\u2019re
      done here."
