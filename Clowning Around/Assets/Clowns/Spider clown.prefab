  - question: Why did the man go on a date with a spider? His wife told him to take
      it out instead of killing it!
    dialogueOne:
    - "I think you\u2019re even cuter!! I love your outfit! *He does a little spider
      dance.*"

    dialogueTwo:
    - "I just wanted to go to Clown Con\u2026 :("
    - "\u2026 I don\u2019t want to think you meant anything harmful, so I guess I\u2019ll
      let it slide\u2026"
  - question: "Oh that\u2019s easy: mind reading! With that kind of power, I would
      be able to instantly know what to say to make someone feel better, or what
      to do to make them laugh!"
    dialogueOne:
    - "I certainly do my best to be!! I want to make everyone smile - that\u2019s
      why I became a clown in the first place! ^-^"
    - What superpower would you want?
    - "Aww don\u2019t be silly; you are doing great! I\u2019m really enjoying our
      time together! Let\u2019s exchange numbers!"
    dialogueTwo:
    - "Oh\u2026"
    - "This has been\u2026 an experience\u2026 I think we should go our separate
      ways\u2026"

    - "Oh wow thank you! *I can\u2019t believe a spider of all things is making me
      blush\u2026* I like your\u2026 makeup?"
    - "That\u2019s awesome! If you could have one superpower, what would it be?"
    responsesTwo:
    - EEK A SPIDER!! GET THIS THING OFF THE TRAIN!!
    - "*Oh no\u2026 I think I hurt its feelings\u2026 I probably shouldn\u2019t have
      said that\u2026* H-hey now\u2026 I\u2019m sorry I got a little scared\u2026
      You must understand, you are a spider. Spiders\u2026 generally aren\u2019t\u2026
      cute\u2026"
    - "*Better change the subject\u2026* If you could have one superpower, what would
      it be?"
  - choice1: I feel like that power could get out of hand
    choice2: "That\u2019s so sweet!"
    responsesOne:
    - "That\u2019s so sweet! You really are a kind little guy, aren\u2019t you?"
    - "You have a heart of gold\u2026 *I think I\u2019m falling for this spider\u2026*"
    - "Maybe the power to be less socially awkward\u2026"
    responsesTwo:
    - "I feel like that power could get out of hand really fast\u2026 I think it
      would make your life a living nightmare."
    - "But if that\u2019s what you want I suppose it\u2019s fine!! *Shoot, I think
      that comment was a little insensitive\u2026*"
